```r-3.0 Changelog```
``Bugfixes``
Fixed info command showing $ instead of # between the author name and discrimination number
Fixed whois command not seeing spaces
Technically not a bugfix, but improved how the changelog command is handled drastically. Now easier to maintain and works better.
Tags can now get other tags (ex: ?tag create GetOtherTag command:tag get SomeOtherTag)

``The new and improved help command``
The help command was pretty much half rewritten and enhanced.
It's now smarter and able to find modules, along with aliases, and will also list aliases of a command if any are present.
If a module is found, it will list the usable commands for the caller, similar to a global help call.
Any specific command can be looked up, and it will display whether the command is usable by the caller or not.

``New commands``
Added a tag validate command which can validate older tags which do not have this info stored
Added a tag claim command which can claim a tag if one isn't claimed, or can transfer ownership to another user, granted that the caller owns the tag
Added a tag unclaim command which can unclaim a tag if you own it
Added a tag info command which can report info of a tag

**Tags**: Why ownership? In the future, you'll be able to apply rulesets to tags you own!

Added 'subscription' commands, see below!

``Subscription system``
**Created a subscription system**:
Each guild can have an unlimited amount of subscriptions. Users can subscribe to channels, they will be granted a 'sub-' role when they do.
A guild administrator will need to specify an admin role for this system, although any user with admin. privileges overrides this.
Admins can call: ?sub create #channel @role
The command finds channels/roles by: name, mention or id. (try to avoid mentions if you can)
Users can call: ?sub <channel> or ?sub me <channel> to subscribe.
Users can call: ?sub list or ?sub list <user> to view possible subscriptions.
See ?help module:sub for more help

``Other``
**You now specifically look for a module help by calling**: ?help module:name
(Should have) fixed most indentation problems for github
Added API version to info command output
Tags now also are stored with: creation date, last edited date, creator, last editor
Improved a lot of command descriptions/usages
Rewritted A LOT of code.
All bot responses should never go over the message limit (2000 chars)

Commands can now be excluded from the help command by naming them 'no-help'

``To-do``
Allow users to create blacklist/whitelist or rulesets for tags they own (eg. disallow a certain user from using their tag, or vice versa)
Allow guilds to have a config to configure things such as: command prefix char, allowed roles per command
Make sure bot doesn't output mentions
Make my own ranking system (similar to meebot's)

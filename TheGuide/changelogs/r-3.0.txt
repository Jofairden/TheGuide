```r-3.0 Changelog```
``Bugfixes``
Fixed info command showing $ instead of # between the author name and discrimination number
Fixed whois command not seeing spaces
Technically not a bugfix, but improved how the changelog command is handled drastically. Now easier to maintain and works better.
Tags can now get other tags (ex: ?tag create GetOtherTag command:tag get SomeOtherTag)

``The new and improved help command``
The help command was pretty much half rewritten and enhanced.
It's now smarter and able to find modules, along with aliases, and will also list aliases of a command if any are present.
If a module is found, it will list the usable commands for the caller, similar to a global help call.
Any specific command can be looked up, and it will display whether the command is usable by the caller or not.

``New commands``
Added a tag validate command which can validate older tags which do not have this info stored
Added a tag claim command which can claim a tag if one isn't claimed, or can transfer ownership to another user, granted that the caller owns the tag
Added a tag unclaim command which can unclaim a tag if you own it
Added a tag info command which can report info of a tag

**Tags**: Why ownership? In the future, you'll be able to apply rulesets to tags you own!

Added 'subscription' commands, see below!

``Subscription system``
**Created a subscription system**:
Each guild can have an unlimited amount of subscriptions. Users can subscribe to channels, they will be granted a 'sub-' role when they do.
A guild administrator will need to specify an admin role for this system, although any user with admin. privileges overrides this.
Admins can call: ?sub create #channel @role
The command finds channels/roles by: name, mention or id. (try to avoid mentions if you can)
Users can call: ?sub <channel> or ?sub me <channel> to subscribe.
Users can call: ?sub list or ?sub list <user> to view possible subscriptions.
See ?help module:sub for more help

``Other``
**You now specifically look for a module help by calling**: ?help module:name
(Should have) fixed most indentation problems for github
Added API version to info command output
Tags now also are stored with: creation date, last edited date, creator, last editor
Improved a lot of command descriptions/usages
Improved TagJson class code
Improved command classes code
Improved and optimized helper methods in Tools class
Improved and optimized TagSystem class
Improved the help command A LOT

Commands can now be excluded from the help command by naming them 'no-help'

``To-do``
Allow users to create blacklist/whitelist or rulesets for tags they own (eg. disallow a certain user from using their tag, or vice versa)
Allow guilds to have a config to configure things such as: command prefix char, allowed roles per command
Make sure bot doesn't output mentions
Make sure commands' output don't go over cap (2000) (mostly done)
Make my own ranking system (similar to meebot's)

```r-3.0 Changelog```
``Bugfixes``
Fixed info command showing $ instead of # between the author name and discrimination number
Fixed whois command not seeing spaces
Technically not a bugfix, but improved how the changelog command is handled drastically. Now easier to maintain and works better.

``The new and improved help command``
The help command was pretty much half rewritten and enhanced.
It's now smarter and able to find modules, along with aliases, and will also list aliases of a command if any are present.
If a module is found, it will list the usable commands for the caller, similar to a global help call.
Any specific command can be looked up, and it will display whether the command is usable by the caller or not.

``New commands``
Added a tag validate command which can validate older tags which do not have this info stored
Added a tag claim command which can claim a tag if one isn't claimed, or can transfer ownership to another user, granted that the caller owns the tag
Added a tag unclaim command which can unclaim a tag if you own it
Added a tag info command which can report info of a tag

``Other``
(Should have) fixed most indentation problems for github
Added API version to info command output
Tags now also are stored with: creation date, last edited date, creator, last editor
Improved a lot of command descriptions/usages

``To-do``
Allow users to create blacklist/whitelist or rulesets for tags they own (eg. disallow a certain user from using their tag, or vice versa)
Allow guilds to have a config to configure things such as: command prefix char, allowed roles per command
Make sure bot doesn't output mentions
Make sure commands' output don't go over cap (2000)
Make my own ranking system (similar to meebot's)
